  <h3>Single to Multisite</h3>
  <p>
    This is an automatic tool allowing to transform site from single one into multisite and back. In addition, it
    can make a complete copy of one of your multisite domains to create a new sub-domain (or sub-path).

  <p>
    Before you launch any operation it is <b>strongly advised to make a complete backup</b>. Even though all operations are
    totally fail-safe to run, nobody canceled force-major situations (as unexpected server or electricity shutdown during operation).
